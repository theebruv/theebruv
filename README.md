## Rodgers Tanui

#### Senior Software Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I engineer complex, user-centric platforms that scale. With over 10 years of experience as a Senior Software Engineer, I specialize in bridging the gap between intuitive UI (Next.js/React) and resilient backend infrastructure (AWS/Terraform).

Recently, I have expanded my technical scope into building Agentic AI and AI-native applications. My current work involves researching and developing autonomous agents, moving beyond simple automation to create intelligent systems that reason and execute complex tasks.

Through Rodgers Labs, I deliver full-stack SaaS solutions and architect decoupled microservices. Whether I am building new AI tools or optimizing enterprise infrastructure, my goal remains the same: designing systems that are efficient, automated, and ready for high-volume traffic.
